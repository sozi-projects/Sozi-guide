◊warning{This book is work in progress. New chapters are added as soon as they are ready, without following a definite schedule. In the meantime, the official documentation for Sozi can still be found on the ◊link["https://sozi.baierouge.fr/"]{web site of the project}.
You can help me dedicate some time to work on this book by ◊link["https://gofund.me/2f2b11db"]{participating in the fundraising campaign} or by ◊link["about-this-book.html#sec-2"]{donating via another service}.
