◊chapter{First presentation: show off your Big Ideas}

◊draft{This chapter is still a draft. Please come back in a few days to read a more complete version.}

The first presentation that we will make together is titled "Big Ideas". As a teaser, let me show you the result that you will get if you follow my instructions.
Click anywhere in the image below and let the presentation play.

◊section{Discover the base document}

This presentation is based on an SVG document that I have created for you using ◊link["https://inkscape.org"]{Inkscape}. Follow the link below to download it, and save it to your preferred location. I recommend to save it in a new folder ◊code{sozi-big-ideas} that will gather all the files of this presentation.

◊itemize-icons{
    ◊link["../assets/en/big-ideas/big-ideas.svg" #:download #t]{◊item-icon["download"]◊code{big-ideas.svg}}
}

◊image["../assets/en/big-ideas-images/big-ideas-initial-folder.png" #:alt "The base document big-ideas.svg in its folder sozi-big-ideas"]

Once the download process is complete, you can open the document ◊code{big-ideas.svg} with Inkscape, inspect its content and modify it to your taste. In the rest of this chapter, we will make modifications to observe the interactions between Inkscape and Sozi.

◊section{Get acquainted with the interface of Sozi}

Now open the document ◊code{big-ideas.svg} with Sozi. The picture below highlights the main areas of the user interface.

◊itemize{
    The ◊link["preview.html"]{preview pane} shows what the camera can see. After opening an SVG document for the first time, it shows the whole document.

    The ◊link["properties.html"]{properties pane} allows you to edit the parameters of the presentation, of the selected frames, and of the transitions between frames.

    The ◊link["toolbar.html"]{toolbar} allows you to select the edition mode for the current frame and to perform various operations: undo/redo the last action, save the presentation, etc. Hover over each button with the mouse cursor to show a tooltip.

    The ◊link["timeline.html"]{timeline} shows the frame sequence. It allows to add, delete, select or reorder frames.
}
